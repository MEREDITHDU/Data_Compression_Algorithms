This project implements some of the most famous data compression algorithms in Java. The algorithms that have been implemented are:

1. Arithmetic Coding
2. Golomb codes
3. Huffman Coding
4. Jpeg: (only to showcase its lossy nature not the algorithm)
5. LZ77
6. LZSS
7. LZW
8. Run Length Coding
9. Unary Coding


Code for testing the outputs has been provided under Test folder.

Each folder contains a README file that decsribes how the code it to be run. It also provides the input and output format.

I have developed a new data compression algorithm based on the LZ77 algorithm and all these algorithms were implemented to compare the performance of my algorithm with these standard algorithms. The code for my new algorithm has not been included in this project.

 If you are interested on working with me on my new data compression algorithm please contact me via mail.
