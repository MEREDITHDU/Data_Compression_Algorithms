This folder contains the code for Run Length coding and decoding algorithm that has been implemented in Java. To run the code follow the following steps:

For running the Encoder:

program file: "run_length.java"
1. The program uses "run_length_input.txt" as the input file. Put the text that has to be compressed here.

2. The program produces "run_length_output.txt" as output file which is the compressed version of the original file.

To run the code type the following commands in the windows command prompt in the given order:

javac run_length.java
java run_length

For running the Decoder:

program file: "run_length_decoder.java"
1. The program uses "run_length_output.txt" as the input file. This is the same as the compressed file generated in previous step.

2. The program produces "run_length_decoded.txt" as output file which is the decompressed version of the compressed file. The contents of this file should be the same as "run_length_input.txt".

To run the code type the following commands in the windows command prompt in the given order:

javac run_length_decoder.java
java run_length_decoder
