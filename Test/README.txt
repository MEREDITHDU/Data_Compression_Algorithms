This folder contains the code for running tests for the algorithms impemented. It checks the input file and the output generated by the decoder and compares the two. Is they are found to be same then the program outputs "success !!". If they differ then the program returns the first point of difference in the files.

You need to copy the input file given to the encoder and the output file generated by the decoder in this folder.
