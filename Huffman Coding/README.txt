This folder contains the code for Huffman Coding algorithm that has been implemented in Java. To run the code follow the following steps:

program file-"JavaApplication1.java"

1. The program uses "huffman_input.txt" as the input file. Put the text that has to be compressed here.

2. The program produces "huffman_output.txt" which is the compressed file.

To run the code type the following commands from the windows command prompt in the given order:

javac JavaApplication1.java
java Arithmetic_coding

The code also generates two other files of importance:

"64_bit.txt" : this is a snapshot of your HDD. It has 64 bit representation of each character in the input file.

"64_bit_def.txt": this is a snapshot of your HDD. It contains the code words taken from huffman tree of each character in the input file 


issues: the code at present returns a null pointer exception. it is being fixed
