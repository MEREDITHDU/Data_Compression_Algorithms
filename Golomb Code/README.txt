For running the Decoder:

program file: "golomb_decoder.java"
1. The program uses "golomb_compressed.txt" as the input file. Put the text that has to be compressed here.

2. The program produces "golomb_decoded.txt" as output file which is the decompressed version of the compressed file. The contents of this file should be the same as "golomb_input.txt".

To run the code type the following commands in the windows command prompt in the given order:
