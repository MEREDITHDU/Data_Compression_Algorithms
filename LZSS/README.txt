This folder contains the code for LZSS coding and decoding algorithm that has been implemented in Java. To run the code follow the following steps:

For running the Encoder:

program file: "lzss.java"
1. The program uses "lzss_input.txt" as the input file. Put the text that has to be compressed here.

2. The program produces "final_output_lzss.txt" as output file which is the compressed version of the original file.

To run the code type the following commands in the windows command prompt in the given order:

javac lzss.java
java lzss

For running the Decoder:

program file: "lzss_decoder.java"
1. The program uses "final_output_lzss.txt" as the input file. Put the text that has to be compressed here.

2. The program produces "lzss_decompressed.txt" as output file which is the decompressed version of the compressed file. The contents of this file should be the same as "lzss_input.txt".

To run the code type the following commands in the windows command prompt in the given order:

javac lzss_decoder.java
java lzss_decoder
